# Big Picture

## Authors

Musca was created by Ruben Casalta in Barcelona as an open source CMS. It evolved during few years while being use by an interactive agency. In 2013 it was forked by another programmer Kuba Markiewicz as a new open source project called Musca Kito. 

## Idea

The idea is that you (a developer) work less and better.
Musca Kito is suppose to be a base to build your own web application with CMS. It is developer friendly, created by developers and for developers. 

What is a framework?
Goals of a framework:
- ease of creation
- create applications better and faster
- extenibility
- maintanance 
- possibility to learn by other developers

What is a CMS?
Goals of a framework:


Goals of a Musca Kit:


The applications created with Musca should be easy to maintain in the future. The code should be easy to understand by a developer who will develope the application in the future. As the business model changes in time and grows, the code should be easy to modify and extend on all levels (DB, MVC).

Programming should be fun. Framework should let you use your programming skills (PHP, SQL). It should not force you to give up what you know and learn new tools.

Freamework should be easy to learn by new developers. 
This can be achived in two ways: providing good documentation or writing a code that is so readable that is does not need documentation.
How do we write a code that is readable?
- simplicity
- short functions
- no globals and static objects
- no hidden dependencies
- descriptive names
- lo abstraction level
- making use of what developer already knows (PHP, MySQL)
- do not rewrite existing PHP functionalities (session, filters, password hash etc)
- using standards

Developer Experience. 
Enjoyable to use for developers.
Developers-centric.
Minimizing the learning curve, making it simple for developers to create powerful applications, fast.
Growing a self-supporting dev community.




programming joy

1. planowanie. modelowanie, wymyślanie
2. tworzysz nowy, czysty plik, zaczynasz pisać z głowy (w twoim ulubionym języku, który znasz perfekcyjnie). kiedy skończysz, odpalasz program i działa, bez błędów!

WNIOSKI

1. Całego programu tak nie napiszesz, ale możesz go podzielić na jak najmniejsze części (ten podział powinien być wymuszony przez framework patrz Caingorm) i każdą z tych części możesz tak właśnie napisać - z głowy. (patrz również unit testing)

2. Powinieneś działać na jak najniższym poziomie i używać podstawowych narzędzi, które masz w małym palcu, tzn: PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no smarty shit!). KISS



## Good practicies of programming

`The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters`

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!





## Framework components

niepodzielne
forma doskonala
daja nieograniczone mozliwosci uzycia, sa uniwersalne
fun - nie wiesz czego sie spodziewac, bawisz sie i patrzysz co wyjdzie

Przyklady klockow:
jezyk, skladnia, funckje PHP
code snippets
