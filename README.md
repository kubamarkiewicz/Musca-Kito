# Big Picture

## Authors

Musca was created by Ruben Casalta in Barcelona as an open source CMS. It evolved during few years while being use by an interactive agency. In 2013 it was forked by another programmer Kuba Markiewicz as a new open source project called Musca Kito. 

## Idea

Musca Kito is suppose to be a tool for a developer, a base to build your own web application with CMS.

The idea is that it should make you work less.
The applications created with Musca should be easy to maintain in the future. The code should be easy to understand by a developer who will develope the application in the future. As the business model changes in time and grows, the code should be easy to modify and extend on all levels (DB, MVC).

Programming should be fun. Framework should let you use your programming skills (PHP, SQL). It should not force you to give up what you know and learn new tools.

Freamework should be easy to learn by new developers. 
This can be achived in two ways: providing good documentation or writing a code that is so readable that is does not need documentation.
How do we write a code that is readable?
- simplicity
- short functions
- no globals and static objects
- no hidden dependencies
- descriptive names
- lo abstraction level
- making use of what developer already knows (PHP, MySQL)
- do not rewrite existing PHP functionalities (session, filters, password hash etc)
- using standards

Developer Experience. 
Enjoyable to use for developers.
Developers-centric.
Minimizing the learning curve, making it simple for developers to create powerful applications, fast.
Growing a self-supporting dev community.
